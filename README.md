crop file is just playing around with data, i.e finding correlations, null values, information etc


 **CROP PREDICTION**
Predicting the optimal crop that could be grown in a particular location based on the
soil composition, rainfall, temperature and return of investment is essential for any
farmer of the modern world. This could not only save farmers from spending extra
money on fertilizers but also avoid the dangerous practice of growing the same crops
on the same patch of land repeatedly, which depletes the solid from its natural
resources.

**OBJECTIVE:**
● Given the dataset, you need to predict what crop would be best for the farmer to
grow based on the geolocation, season, and price.
● Make a user-friendly interface for the public to interact with your ML model.
